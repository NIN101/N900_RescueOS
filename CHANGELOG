0.5.4 2013-01-05 
Nothing special but useful changes:
-midnight commander removed as it was eating too much space and I doubt people were actually using it.
-Now after bootup, the system asks the user whether he wants to enable anonymous ftp up and downloads everywhere.
Then whether telnetd should be started and finally asks whether usb networking should be enabled.
=================================
0.5.3
Short note: it disappeared from the server (some problems with my hoster).
Development is pretty much stalled. I am focusing on other things.
Contributions otoh are still welcome.


-Including Pali's script which should fix some messed up maemo /dev/ device nodes (iirc, this can happen with uboot fun)


0.5 2012-03-03, version 0.5.2
Boring and nothing exciting:
* tar is now gnu tar, not busybox's version for convenience
* /tmp/ for some reason never existed, now it does :S
* Mountpoints /mnt/free1, /mnt/free2, /mnt/free3 (how noteworthy!) 
* PS1 was set to show the current directory you are in.


0.5 2012-01-22, version 0.5.1
* Battery capacity watchdog tells user at 45 % capacity to charge the 
  battery. Type "stfu" if the messages annoy you.

* Updated busybox to 1.19.3
* User can append autostart=/path... option in the kernel

* tcpsvd included for ftpd. For example, "tcpsvd -v 0.0.0.0 21 
  ftpd -w" enables anonymous down- and uploads everywhere. 
* By Request: Midnight Commander 4.8 included. As functions 
  keys are not available/mapped, use ESC+number. Still borked. 
* cleaner shutdown.
